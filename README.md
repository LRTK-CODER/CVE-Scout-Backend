NVD에서 CVE 정보를 파싱한 정보를 REST API로 공유하는 프로젝트

## Build Environment
pyenv - python v3.11.3</br>
mongoDB - v6.0.5</br>

### Setting up CVE Crawling
1. git clone or download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bug-hunting-project/CVE-Scout.git
cd CVE-Scout
```

2. Install requirements
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Crawling Code
To crawl all CVE data from NVD's API, run the following command:
```bash
python nvd_crawl.py all
```
This command will save all the CVE data as a JSON file and store it in MongoDB.

4. Set up Crontab for Regular CVE Updates
To periodically update the CVE data, you can set up a crontab job. For example, if you want to update the data every day at 11:50 AM, open the crontab file with the command:
```bash
crontab -e
```

And then add the following line:
```bash
50 11 * * * python [Path]/nvd_crawl.py update
```
This will run nvd_crawl.py with the all argument every day at 11:50 AM. Remember to replace [Path] with the actual path to the nvd_crawl.py script. Save the file and exit to schedule the job.
